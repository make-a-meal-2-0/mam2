Total time:
  45 min – Prep time: 10 min – Cook time: 35 min

Directions:

Step 1: Steaming

1. Place a large pot on the stove with a metal steaming basket or colander inside. Fill with water just to the bottom of the basket and bring to a boil.

2. Meanwhile, clean and trim your artichokes: Remove some of the tough outer leaves near the stem. With a serrated knife, slice off the top 1/4 of each artichoke. Then, slice most of the stem off. With shears, clip the pointy ends off of the outermost leaves.

3. Cut the artichokes in half lengthwise if they are medium sized. If large, cut into quarters. Scrape out the hairy choke in the center of each section with a spoon. (It is called a choke for a reason).

Please note that if your artichokes are going to sit exposed to the air for even one minute you should rub them with lemon juice or place them in a bowl of acidulated water (water with a little lemon or vinegar) to deter oxidation and discoloration.

4. Place the halves or quarters core side down in the steamer basket. Reduce the heat to a simmer. Place a lid on top of the pot and simmer for approximately 20 to 25 minutes until the inside of the artichoke is tender. (check after 20 minutes). Make the dipping sauce while the artichokes are steaming – directions to follow.

5. Remove the basket and let the artichokes come to room temperature so you can handle them comfortably.

Step 2: Grilling

1. Heat the Foreman grill to high.

2. Rub the cooled artichoke sections all over with the EVOO, lemon juice, garlic, salt and pepper.

3. Place the artichokes core side down on the grill and close the top. Cook for 10 minutes.

4. Serve with the dipping sauce. This is a dish that does not require utensils.

Dipping Sauce

1. Mix all of the sauce ingredients together in a glass bowl. Feel free to add a little salt and pepper if desired. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until the artichokes are finished grilling. Serve alongside the grilled artichoke sections.
