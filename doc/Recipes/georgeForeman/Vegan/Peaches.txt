Ingredients:

  -4 Ripe pink or yellow peaches
  -1 TBS butter


Total time: 5 min – Prep time: 1 min – Cook time: 4 min

Directions:

  Slice the peaches in half all the way around the stones. Remove the stones and discard.

Heat the Foreman Grill to high.

  Butter the bottom grill plate. Place the peach halves flesh side down on the hot grill. Do not close the grill! Grill the peaches for 3 or 4 minutes until just caramelized and showing nice marks. You can just as easily do this on a George Foreman indoor/outdoor grill.

Slice the peaches and place on a plate. You can drizzle honey on them if you want more sweetness.

    Here is where it got interesting. I did not drizzle the honey on the peaches. I just left them on the plate with a fork and walked away to do something else. I never got around to making the fruit salad. I left bananas and blueberries on the counter next to the peaches.

    As people started waking up and making their way to the kitchen, I could hear “mmmmm”s every few minutes. So, I went back into the kitchen to find that most of the sliced, grilled peaches were gone. Some people had just eaten them right off of the plate. Others put them in yogurt that we had on hand. And one guest asked if I had any ice cream to have with the peaches. Yes, they were that good just simply grilled.
