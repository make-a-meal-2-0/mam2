Ingredients:

      -2 tsp baking powder
      -1/2 tsp baking soda
      -1/2 tsp sea salt
      -1/2 tsp cinnamon
      -1/8 tsp pure stevia powder (or 4 TBS pure maple syrup)
      -1/2 cup brown rice flour
      -1/4 cup buckwheat flour
      -1/4 cup arrowroot
      -1/4 cup + 2 TBS nut or rice milk (only 2 TBS if using maple syrup)
      -3/4 cup + 2 TBS applesauce
      -4 tsp vegetable oil
      -2 tsp pure vanilla extract
      -Vegetable oil cooking spray

Total time:
  20 min – Prep time: 14 min – Cook time: 6 min

Directions:

      You will need 2 bowls. In one bowl place the dry ingredients and whisk. Stir the wet ingredients in the other bowl. Pour wet into dry and stir well.

      While the mixture rests for a few minutes, coat the plates with the oil spray and preheat the grill just as described in the first recipe. When the grill is ready, pour 2/3 cup of the batter into the preheated bottom waffle plate and cook for approximately 5 minutes.

      Serve these warm with healthy toppings of fresh berries, coconut milk yogurt, or very dark vegan chocolate chunks (or all of these).

      Let’s Bring a Kitchen Tradition Back

      Remember homemade waffles on cold winter mornings? There is something about the sweet smell of real waffles when they are cooking. It must be the way a waffle iron emits vapors or steam as the batter cooks at a very high heat. That never happens with a toaster waffle.

      The thing that is so great about waffles is that they can be either sweet or savory. An herb and cheddar cheese waffle recipe comes to mind when thinking of a savory version. Southern fried chicken and waffles is probably the best combination of both sweet and savory.

      However you like your waffles, try making a homemade batch the next time you a little time to spare. Homemade waffles are one of the most classic comfort foods. Have them for breakfast with sweet fruit, dinner with meat and gravy piled on top, or for dessert with ice cream. Make waffles the classic way, or make a healthier version. There are no rules other than to enjoy them.
