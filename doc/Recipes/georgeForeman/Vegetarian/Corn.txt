Ingredients

-2 to 4 ears of fresh corn, depending on grill size
-Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)
-Sea salt
-Freshly ground pepper


Total time:
  13 min – Prep time: 5 min – Cook time: 8 min

Directions

    Preheat the Foreman grill, with standard ridged grill plates, to 375°F.

    Shuck and remove the silks from the corn.

    On a plate or cutting board, brush or drizzle EVOO all over the corn, then sprinkle with salt and pepper.

    Place the ears on the hot grill between the ridges, so they sit steady in the valleys, and cover with the top. Cook for 5 minutes. Roll 90 degrees. Cook another 3 minutes.

    Serve with a little butter as a side dish to your favorite main entrée.

    Note: If you want grill marks, try placing the corn horizontally at 90 degrees to the ridges. They do tend to roll doing it this way, so you will have to experiment.
