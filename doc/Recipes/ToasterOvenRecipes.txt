Oven Toasted Bacon {

Prep Time: 12m - 15 minutes

Instructions: 

Set the temperature to 400°F, and lay the bacon slices (we like thick cut here) flat on a baking sheet or your toaster oven pan. 
Bake, for about 12-15 minutes, or until the bacon is done to your liking.
If you want to make cleanup as easy as possible, line your pan with aluminum foil or parchment paper prior to placing the bacon slices.
When your bacon is finished cooking, it will be crispy, but light, in a unique way.

In a medium bowl whisk together the olive oil, sriracha sauce and garlic salt.

Using oven mitts carefully remove the heated roasting pan from your oven or toaster oven.

Roasted Carrots {

Prep Time: 1 HOUR 35 MINUTES

Instructions: 

Adjust your toaster oven’s cooking rack to the bottom position and preheat to 325°F. Line the bottom of a quarter sheet pan with a silicone baking mat. If using a different metal pan, lightly grease the bottom and sides with oil.
In a microwave-safe bowl combine the oil, peanut butter, maple syrup and brown sugar. Heat in the microwave until warmed and the peanut butter begins to melt, about 20 to 30 seconds. Stir the mixture well to combine and add the vanilla and salt.
In a large bowl combine the oats, coconut, and peanuts.
Pour peanut butter mixture over oats and nuts, stir well to make sure everything is coated. Pour into the prepared pan. Use a spatula or the bottom of a heavy measuring cup to press and compact the granola into an even layer.
Bake at 325°F until the granola is light golden brown all over, about 18 to 22 minutes.
While granola is still warm sprinkle with chocolate chips. After 1 minutes use an offset spatula to spread the melted chocolate around the top of the granola.
Allow granola to cool in the pan for at least 1 hour, then break into clumps.

Ingredients: {2 tablespoons neutral oil (like canola oil),
1/3 cup natural peanut butter,
2 tablespoons real maple syrup,

1/2 cup unsweetened coconut chips/large flake coconut,
