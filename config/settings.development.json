If it’s too spicy for your kids, then garlic salt and lemon pepper will be a good choice.\n\n  Next place your salmon on the grill with the spiced side down. When it’s on the grill, rub the seasoning on the other side of the salmon. Try not to burn your hands.\n\n  Close the lid and let it cook. Good time for salmon fillet is 3-4 minutes and salmon steak 6-8 minutes. I suggest you to cook for the minimum time first and then start to check the salmon for readiness. Salmon fillet is done when it turns opaque and flakes when you stick it with a fork.\n\n  Enjoy your perfectly blackened salmon!",

There is something about the sweet smell of real waffles when they are cooking. It must be the way a waffle iron emits vapors or steam as the batter cooks at a very high heat. That never happens with a toaster waffle.\n\n      The thing that is so great about waffles is that they can be either sweet or savory. An herb and cheddar cheese waffle recipe comes to mind when thinking of a savory version. Southern fried chicken and waffles is probably the best combination of both sweet and savory.\n\n      However you like your waffles, try making a homemade batch the next time you a little time to spare. Homemade waffles are one of the most classic comfort foods. Have them for breakfast with sweet fruit, dinner with meat and gravy piled on top, or for dessert with ice cream. Make waffles the classic way, or make a healthier version. There are no rules other than to enjoy them.",

Fill with water just to the bottom of the basket and bring to a boil.\n\nMeanwhile, clean and trim your artichokes: Remove some of the tough outer leaves near the stem. With a serrated knife, slice off the top 1/4 of each artichoke. Then, slice most of the stem off. With shears, clip the pointy ends off of the outermost leaves.\n\nCut the artichokes in half lengthwise if they are medium sized. If large, cut into quarters. Scrape out the hairy choke in the center of each section with a spoon. (It is called a choke for a reason).\n\nPlease note that if your artichokes are going to sit exposed to the air for even one minute you should rub them with lemon juice or place them in a bowl of acidulated water (water with a little lemon or vinegar) to deter oxidation and discoloration.\n\nPlace the halves or quarters core side down in the steamer basket. Reduce the heat to a simmer. Place a lid on top of the pot and simmer for approximately 20 to 25 minutes until the inside of the artichoke is tender. (check after 20 minutes). Make the dipping sauce while the artichokes are steaming – directions to follow.\n\nRemove the basket and let the artichokes come to room temperature so you can handle them comfortably.\n\nStep 2: Grilling\n\nHeat the Foreman grill to high.\n\nRub the cooled artichoke sections all over with the EVOO, lemon juice, garlic, salt and pepper.\n\nPlace the artichokes core side down on the grill and close the top. Cook for 10 minutes.\n\nServe with the dipping sauce. This is a dish that does not require utensils.\n\nStep 3: Dipping Sauce\n\nMix all of the sauce ingredients together in a glass bowl. Feel free to add a little salt and pepper if desired. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until the artichokes are finished grilling. Serve alongside the grilled artichoke sections.\n",
