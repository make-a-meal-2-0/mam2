Ingredients:

-1 tbs of margarine


Total time:

    8 min – Prep time: 5 min – Cook time: 3 min

Directions:


    This is a real easy one. Preheat your Foreman Grill for at least 5 minutes. Use medium-high setting if your grill has temperature settings. Place the cheese between the bread slices and spread the margarine on the outside of each slice in a nice thin layer. Place on the grill, close lid, and check after about 3 minutes. Your sandwich is done when the bread is a beautiful golden brown and the cheese is melting. Enjoy!
