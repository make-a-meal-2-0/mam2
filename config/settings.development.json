Cover only half the tortilla with cheese and add chicken, green onions, coriander and tomatoes. Fold other half of the tortilla over the top of the cheese and chicken and then brush both top and bottom with olive oil. Grill for 4 – 6 minutes until cheese is nice and melted and tortilla is golden brown.\n\n    Remove from grill and use a knife or pizza cutter and slice the quesadilla into 4 pieces.\n\n    Serve with sour cream and guacamole.",

      "directions": "First warm up your Foreman Grill for about 5 minutes with lid closed. Use the high settings if your grill has the temperature controls.\n\n  Now dry rub your salmon on one side. You don’t need any oils or butter. You can use pretty much any seasoning you like. Personally I prefer cajun seasoning. Cajun blackened salmon is just the best. If it’s too spicy for your kids, then garlic salt and lemon pepper will be a good choice.\n\n  Next place your salmon on the grill with the spiced side down. When it’s on the grill, rub the seasoning on the other side of the salmon. Try not to burn your hands.\n\n  Close the lid and let it cook. Good time for salmon fillet is 3-4 minutes and salmon steak 6-8 minutes. I suggest you to cook for the minimum time first and then start to check the salmon for readiness. Salmon fillet is done when it turns opaque and flakes when you stick it with a fork.\n\n  Enjoy your perfectly blackened salmon!",
