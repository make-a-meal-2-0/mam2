Ingredients:

  -1 (14 ounce) package of extra firm tofu in block form, packed in water
  -2 TBS toasted sesame oil
  -2 TBS tamari, soy sauce, or liquid aminos
  -1 TBS balsamic vinegar or mirin
  -1/2 tsp ground ginger


Total time:
  5 hour 5 min – Prep time: 5 hour – Cook time: 5 min

Directions:

    1. Open the tofu package and drain all the liquid off. Place the block of tofu on a cutting board and slice into 6 equal portions, approximately 3/4″ thick each.

    2. Place a clean towel or 2 layers of paper towels on a flat surface. Put the tofu slices on the towel and cover them with another towel or paper towels. Press gently to release the water. Repeat this with dry towels until the tofu releases most of its water.

    3. In a medium storage container, mix the marinade ingredients. Coat the tofu on all surfaces with the marinade, cover, and place in the refrigerator for 2 to 12 hours. (4-1/2 hours worked fine for this recipe).

    4. Remove the tofu from the refrigerator and allow it to come to room temperature, about 30 minutes.

    5. Heat the Foreman Grill to medium high.

    6. Grill the tofu with the top closed for approximately 5 minutes. It should be brown and have distinct grill marks. Cut into strips or cubes and serve over rice with other vegetables. See the next recipe for serving suggestion.
